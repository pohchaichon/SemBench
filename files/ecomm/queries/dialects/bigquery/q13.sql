    I am looking for a running shirt for men with a round neck and short sleeves,
    preferably in blue or black, but not bright colors like white.
    Also definitely not green.
    It should be suitable for outdoor running in warm weather.
    If the t-shirt is not green, it should at least feature a striped design.

    The product has the following image''',
    images.ref, ' and textual description ',
    styles_details.productDisplayName, ' ',
    styles_details.productDescriptors.description.value
  ),
  connection_id => '<<connection>>',
  model_params => JSON '{"labels":{"query_uuid": "<<query_id>>"}}' <<other_params>>)
;
