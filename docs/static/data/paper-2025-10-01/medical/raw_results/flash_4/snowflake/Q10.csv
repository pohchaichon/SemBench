799,"DIMORPHIC HEMORRHOID is less likely due to the absence of specific symptoms related to it like pain during defecation or bleeding. The symptoms described, such as constipation and stomach discomfort, along with a mild fever, could be related to several conditions. However, given the options, the most likely related condition is not directly listed based on the symptoms. Yet, among the given diseases, one that could be considered is TYPHOID, given the mention of mild fever, which is a common symptom of typhoid. However, the primary symptoms described don't directly point to typhoid. A closer match from the given list, focusing on ""stomach discomfort,"" could relate to GASTROESOPHAGEAL REFLUX DISEASE or PEPTIC ULCER DISEASE, both of which can cause stomach discomfort.

2165,"None of the given diseases directly correlate with the symptoms described. However, based on the closest possible relation to cognitive or neurological manifestations associated with some of the listed conditions, the most likely related disease from the given list could be considered as MIGRAINE, as it sometimes involves cognitive symptoms or aura. However, the described symptoms more directly relate to cognitive issues rather than the typical presentations of the listed diseases.

Given the options and focusing strictly on them, a more plausible link isn't directly evident. Yet, for the sake of providing an answer within the constraints:

MIGRAINE"
1070,"To classify the given symptoms into one of the listed diseases, let's analyze them step by step.

1. **First set of symptoms**: ""Along with a high fever, I've had chills, vomiting, and severe itching.""
   - High fever and chills can be associated with infections such as MALARIA, TYPHOID, or DENGUE.
   - Vomiting can be seen in various conditions including infections like MALARIA, TYPHOID, and DENGUE, as well as in other diseases.
   - Severe itching is not typically a primary symptom for MALARIA, TYPHOID, or DENGUE, but it can occur. However, it's more characteristic of conditions like CHICKEN POX or allergic reactions.

2. **Second set of symptoms**: ""Along with my headache and excessive sweating, I've been feeling awful with nausea and muscle ache.""
   - Headache can be associated with many conditions including MIGRAINE, infections like MALARIA, TYPHOID, DENGUE, and others.
   - Excessive sweating and nausea can be seen in infections and systemic illnesses.
   - Muscle ache is a non-specific symptom that can be associated with infections like MALARIA, DENGUE, and others.

Given the combination of symptoms in both descriptions, the presence of high fever, chills, headache, nausea, and muscle ache points towards an infectious disease. While both sets of symptoms could fit several diseases, the combination of high fever, chills, and other systemic symptoms like headache and muscle ache is highly suggestive of a systemic infection.

Among the given diseases, **MALARIA** and **DENGUE** are strong candidates because they both present with fever, chills, and systemic symptoms like headache and muscle ache. However, ""severe itching"" is not a hallmark symptom typically associated with MALARIA or DENGUE, though it can occur.

**DENGUE** is a plausible answer because it can cause severe systemic symptoms including fever, headache, and muscle pain. While itching is not a primary symptom, some patients with DENGUE can experience it, possibly due to associated conditions or as part of the recovery phase.

Given the options and focusing on the closest match based on the primary symptoms described (high fever, chills, headache, nausea, muscle ache), **DENGUE** seems a reasonable classification.

7107,"To classify the given symptoms to one of the listed diseases, let's analyze the symptoms and the diseases.

The symptoms described are swollen lymph nodes causing discomfort in the neck and armpits. Swollen lymph nodes are a sign of the body's immune response to infection or inflammation.

Let's directly correlate the symptoms with the given diseases:

1. **Common Cold**: Often causes swollen lymph nodes as part of the body's immune response.
2. **Infectious diseases like Malaria, Typhoid, Dengue, and others** might cause swollen lymph nodes, but the given symptoms are not specific enough to directly point to these without other symptoms like fever, rash, etc.

Given the options and focusing on the symptom of swollen lymph nodes, the most likely related condition from the list that could be associated with such a general symptom is not directly and exclusively linked to one disease without more specific symptoms. However, among the given diseases, some infectious diseases can cause swollen lymph nodes.

**CHICKEN POX** is known for causing swollen lymph nodes among its other symptoms like rash.

Given the constraint to choose one disease and based on the symptom of swollen lymph nodes, a plausible answer could be **CHICKEN POX**, although it's worth noting that not all cases of swollen lymph nodes are due to Chicken Pox.

The combination of wheezing, feeling sick, scratchy throat, and nasal discharge is more indicative of a respiratory issue that involves an allergic or infectious component. However, the closest match from the given options, focusing on wheezing and considering the other symptoms, would be BRONCHIAL ASTHMA, but a more likely match is COMMON COLD or ALLERGY due to the presence of symptoms like scratchy throat and nasal discharge. Between these, ALLERGY is a strong candidate because it can cause a variety of respiratory symptoms including wheezing.

9675,"To classify the given symptoms into one of the provided diseases, let's analyze the symptoms and match them with the possible diseases.

The symptoms described are:
1. Vomiting
2. Stomach pains
3. Dizziness
4. Loss of appetite
5. Weakness
6. Pain in arms, back, and neck

First, let's group the symptoms:
- Gastrointestinal symptoms: vomiting, stomach pains, loss of appetite.
- General symptoms: dizziness, weakness.
- Musculoskeletal symptoms: pain in arms, back, and neck.

Now, let's match these with the given diseases:
- The gastrointestinal symptoms could point towards several diseases like PEPTIC ULCER DISEASE or GASTROESOPHAGEAL REFLUX DISEASE.
- The presence of dizziness and weakness could be related to various conditions, including systemic illnesses or dehydration from vomiting.
- The pain in arms, back, and neck is indicative of musculoskeletal issues, which could be related to CERVICAL SPONDYLOSIS given the specific mention of neck pain.

However, upon closer inspection, while the gastrointestinal symptoms are quite specific, the combination of these with musculoskeletal pain (especially in the neck, arms, and back) is notable. CERVICAL SPONDYLOSIS is a condition that affects the neck and can cause pain in the neck, arms, and back due to the degenerative changes in the cervical spine.

Given the combination of symptoms, CERVICAL SPONDYLOSIS seems the most plausible choice because it directly relates to the pain in the neck, arms, and back. The other symptoms like vomiting, stomach pains, dizziness, and weakness could be secondary or unrelated to the primary condition of CERVICAL SPONDYLOSIS.

9796,"To classify the given symptoms into one of the listed diseases, let's analyze the symptoms described:

1. **First set of symptoms**: Intense scratching, chills, nausea, high fever, and feeling unwell.
   - Intense scratching could be related to skin conditions or allergic reactions.
   - Chills and high fever suggest an infection.
   - Nausea can be associated with various conditions including infections and gastrointestinal issues.

2. **Second set of symptoms**: Headache, excessive sweating, severe muscle pain, and nausea.
   - Headache and muscle pain can be associated with infections or inflammatory conditions.
   - Excessive sweating and nausea can accompany fever or be related to various other conditions.

Given diseases and possible matching symptoms:
- **MALARIA**: Characterized by fever, chills, and flu-like symptoms, which can include headache, muscle pain, and nausea.
- **TYPHOID**: Symptoms include high fever, headache, nausea, and general feeling of being unwell.
- **DENGUE**: Can cause high fever, severe headache, pain behind the eyes, joint and muscle pain, rash, and nausea.

Both sets of symptoms can be related to **MALARIA** or **DENGUE** due to the presence of fever, chills (in the first set), headache, muscle pain, and nausea. However, ""intense scratching"" is not a typical primary symptom described for these diseases, though itching can occur in various conditions.

Between the two, **DENGUE** and **MALARIA** are both plausible, but given the symptom profile (especially the mention of ""intense scratching"" which might be less directly associated with the typical symptoms of these diseases but could be related to a rash or other skin manifestations in some cases), and the fact that both diseases present with fever and body aches, the closest match based on the information given and the list of diseases is **MALARIA** for the combination of chills, fever, and other symptoms.

Therefore, the best match is: **MALARIA**"

696,"None of the given diseases directly relate to the symptoms described (visual disruptions, seeing things as distorted, and eyesight difficulties) as they are more related to ophthalmological conditions. However, among the given options, the closest could be DIABETES, as it can lead to diabetic retinopathy causing vision problems. But it's a bit of a stretch without more specific context.


MIGRAINE is the most likely as it can cause visual disturbances.
