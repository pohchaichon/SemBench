SemBench is a benchmark targeting a novel class of systems: **semantic query processing engines**. Those systems rely inherently on generative and reasoning  capabilities of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). They extend SQL with semantic operators, configured by natural language instructions, that are evaluated via LLMs and enable users to perform various operations on multimodal data.

SemBench introduces diversity across three key dimensions: **scenarios, modalities, and operators**. Included are scenarios ranging from movie review analysis to medical question-answering. Within these scenarios, we cover different data modalities, including images, audio, text, and table. Finally, the queries involve a diverse set of operators, including semantic filters, joins, mappings, ranking, and classification operators. 

Currently SemBench is evalulated on **three academic systems (LOTUS, Palimpzest, and ThalamusDB) and one industrial system, Google BigQuery**. Although these results reflect a snapshot of systems under continuous development, our study offers crucial insights into their current strengths and weaknesses, illuminating promising directions for future research.

We understand that every system is under rapid development, which is why we maintain an [online leaderboard](https://sembench.ngrok.io/). We encourage you to submit your system's results and participate in the benchmark. Please reach out to discuss how to contribute your results to the leaderboard.

## To Users: SemBench — A Simple, Ready-to-Use Benchmark

We understand that downloading datasets, generating databases, and setting up environments can be tedious—especially in the systems area, where each system often requires a unique setup. SemBench automates all of these steps for you! It automatically downloads datasets and generates multi-modal databases. Setting up environments for SemBench and four supported systems (LOTUS, Palimpzest, ThalamusDB, and BigQuery) takes just one script.

So, enjoy using SemBench! We believe a good benchmark should minimize user effort—and SemBench is designed exactly for that.

## 🌟 Overview

Modern data systems increasingly need to process and reason over multi-modal data - combining traditional relational data with images, audio, and text. SemBench provides a standardized evaluation framework with:

- **5 Real-world Scenarios**: wildlife monitoring, medical diagnosis, sentiment analysis of movie reviews, question anwering, E-commerce product analysis
- **Multi-modal Queries**: Complex semantic operations across multi-modal databases: table, text, image, and audio  
- **System-agnostic Design**: Extensible and already supports LOTUS, Palimpzest, ThalamusDB, CAESURA, BigQuery, DuckDB FlockMTL
- **Comprehensive Metrics**: Quality (precision/recall/F1, relative error...), cost (money, token consumption), and efficiency evaluation (execution time)
- **Rich Visualizations**: Automated generation of performance comparisons
